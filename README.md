# -IBM-Code-Call-for-Code-Preparing-for-Natural-Disasters-with-next-generation-tech.
The IBM Call for Code initiative focuses on creating solutions to help communities respond to natural disasters, improve disaster preparedness, and support resilience. Developing solutions for natural disaster preparedness using next-generation technologies like AI, IoT, blockchain, cloud computing, and data science can dramatically enhance disaster response and save lives.

Below is an example of a Python-based disaster management solution using IBM Watson for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze emergency data, AI for predicting disasters, and integrating with IoT sensors for real-time disaster tracking. This project is designed to be scalable, leveraging IBM Cloud and IBM Watson tools.
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Install the required Python libraries that interact with IBM Watson services and IoT devices:

pip install ibm-watson requests flask paho-mqtt

Step 2: Set Up IBM Watson NLP (Natural Language Processing) for Disaster Response

We’ll use IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to analyze emergency messages and tweets during a disaster to assess the situation and provide appropriate responses.
Code for IBM Watson NLP Integration

import json
from ibm_watson import NaturalLanguageUnderstandingV1
from ibm_watson.natural_language_understanding_v1 import Features, SentimentOptions, EntitiesOptions

# Set up Watson NLU credentials (replace with your IBM Watson NLU service credentials)
apikey = 'YOUR_WATSON_NLU_API_KEY'
url = 'YOUR_WATSON_NLU_URL'

# Initialize NLU instance
nlu = NaturalLanguageUnderstandingV1(version='2021-08-01', iam_apikey=apikey, url=url)

# Function to analyze tweets or emergency messages
def analyze_disaster_message(text):
    response = nlu.analyze(
        text=text,
        features=Features(
            sentiment=SentimentOptions(),
            entities=EntitiesOptions(emotion=True, sentiment=True, limit=2)
        )
    ).get_result()

    sentiment = response['sentiment']['document']['label']
    entities = response['entities']
    
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
    print(f"Entities: {entities}")

    # Provide insight based on sentiment and entities
    if sentiment == "negative":
        print("This seems to be a disaster-related message. Immediate action is required.")
    elif sentiment == "positive":
        print("The situation seems manageable, but monitor for any updates.")
    
    return entities, sentiment

# Example message during a disaster (could be a tweet or an emergency message)
message = "There is a massive flood happening right now. Roads are submerged, people need help!"
analyze_disaster_message(message)

Explanation:

    This code utilizes IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to analyze disaster-related messages such as tweets or emergency communications. The message is analyzed for sentiment (positive or negative) and entities (e.g., flood, earthquake, etc.).
    Depending on the sentiment and entities found, the system can trigger specific responses for disaster management.

Step 3: IoT Sensors for Real-Time Disaster Monitoring

We can integrate IoT devices to collect real-time data from disaster-prone areas. For example, sensors can monitor parameters such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, or geolocation during a natural disaster to improve the prediction and monitoring of events like earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes.
Example of IoT Sensor Integration Using MQTT

We'll simulate sending IoT data (e.g., temperature, humidity) over MQTT to an IBM Cloud endpoint. The data could come from real sensors placed in the field.

import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import random
import time

# Define MQTT parameters
mqtt_broker = "mqtt.eclipse.org"
mqtt_port = 1883
mqtt_topic = "disaster/sensors"

# Callback function when connecting to MQTT broker
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print(f"Connected with result code {rc}")
    client.subscribe(mqtt_topic)

# Callback function to handle message publishing
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"Message received: {msg.payload.decode()}")

# Create MQTT client
client = mqtt.Client()
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

# Connect to the broker
client.connect(mqtt_broker, mqtt_port, 60)

# Start the MQTT loop in a separate thread
client.loop_start()

# Simulate sending IoT sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity) every 5 seconds
while True:
    temperature = random.uniform(20.0, 45.0)  # Simulating temperature in °C
    humidity = random.uniform(30.0, 90.0)  # Simulating humidity in percentage
    sensor_data = f"Temperature: {temperature} °C, Humidity: {humidity}%"
    
    # Publish the sensor data to the MQTT broker
    client.publish(mqtt_topic, sensor_data)
    print(f"Sent data: {sensor_data}")
    
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait 5 seconds before sending next data point

Explanation:

    This code simulates sending data from an IoT sensor (temperature and humidity) every 5 seconds using MQTT.
    The MQTT broker is used to publish sensor data to a topic, which can then be received by a subscriber for further processing.
    The data can be further processed to detect anomalies (e.g., unusually high temperatures indicating wildfires) or use in predicting disasters like floods or earthquakes.

Step 4: Disaster Prediction with AI (Machine Learning)

Predicting natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes involves analyzing historical data and applying machine learning models for prediction.

Here’s a simple example using scikit-learn to predict the likelihood of a flood based on historical data like temperature, humidity, and rainfall:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example dataset: [Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall] -> Target: 1 (Flood), 0 (No Flood)
data = np.array([
    [30.5, 85, 0.5, 1],
    [32.0, 90, 0.7, 1],
    [35.0, 80, 0.4, 0],
    [29.0, 70, 0.3, 0],
    [28.0, 60, 0.2, 0],
    [33.0, 92, 1.2, 1],
    [34.0, 88, 1.0, 1],
    [25.0, 65, 0.1, 0],
])

# Features: Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
X = data[:, :-1]
# Target: 1 for flood, 0 for no flood
y = data[:, -1]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Flood Prediction Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Predicting flood likelihood for new data
new_data = np.array([[31.0, 89, 0.8]])  # New input data: Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
prediction = clf.predict(new_data)
print("Flood Prediction (1 = Yes, 0 = No):", prediction)

Explanation:

    This code uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a flood is likely based on input features like temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
    The model is trained on a small dataset (for demonstration purposes), and predictions can be made for new data points.
    This can be extended with more complex models and additional environmental factors for more accurate predictions.

Step 5: Integrate with IBM Cloud for Scalability and Real-Time Data Processing

To deploy this solution on IBM Cloud, you would:

    Deploy the Flask API to IBM Cloud’s Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes for managing and scaling your disaster response application.
    Use IBM Cloud Functions to trigger actions based on real-time data from IoT sensors, Watson analysis, or disaster predictions.
    Utilize IBM Cloud Databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing sensor data and disaster logs.
    Integrate with IBM Watson Studio to build more advanced machine learning models and IBM Watson IoT for managing real-time sensor data streams.

Conclusion:

This code demonstrates an example of a natural disaster preparedness application using next-generation technologies like AI, IoT, blockchain, and cloud services. By combining IBM Watson NLU, IoT sensors, and machine learning models, we can help detect, predict, and respond to natural disasters in real-time.

To fully deploy this system, you'd need to integrate with the IBM Cloud platform and use the above code to analyze data from real-world IoT sensors, process that data, and provide actionable insights in response to natural disasters.
